## Hello

My name's Mish, well, sort of...let's just say it's short for a seemingly easy
name which lot's of people find ridiculously hard to pronounce.

I've had lot's of practice though (what with it being my name) so I generally
explain it to others as if they were about eight. "It's 'Mish' like 'fish'."
Given that the phonetics of [fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti) can
be confusing in their own right I guess it's no surprise the ensuing difficulty.

## What I don't do

I don't race motorcycles, cliff jump, snorkel with sharks (intentionally, but boy was I surprised).
The things I don't do are far more interesting than the things I get around to doing.
But I usually do them with such glee that it can get really awkward (and contagious).
