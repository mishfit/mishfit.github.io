Representation is a Myth

Your vote, generally once every 365 (and some odd) days constitutes your “representation”. That is, after having cast your ballot in an election, one in which several things can occur:

1. Your chosen candidate wins and assumes office
2. Your chosen candidate loses and a representative you did not choose assumes office
3. You determine that none of the candidates reflects your set of values and either abstain from voting or write in another candidate. One of the candidates wins and assumes office


A representative of yours (one that you either selected or you didn’t) attempts to create laws to shape how you live your life.

Over the course of their term, regardless of how well they did their job (good or bad). Your only opportunity to reward or punish them is at the end of their term in the next election. This action could result in the same set of things happening as in the last election…it is possible that if you try to punish them for a job poorly done…they won’t be punished at all. It is possible that if you try to reward them with a vote cast in their favor, they do not get rewarded with another term.



_**What is your recourse if your chosen candidate wins and begins to act in ways with which you disagree?**_

_**What is your recourse if none of the candidates are acceptable to you? Are you represented better? Or worse? Or perhaps not at all?**_

_**How does your chosen candidate represent unique individuals in your area who have completely different viewpoints from you?**_

_**If winning an election can be likened to a popularity contest, then what are the incentives for the winners? Does representing you well (and others poorly) guarantee an increase in popularity (i.e. votes)?**_
