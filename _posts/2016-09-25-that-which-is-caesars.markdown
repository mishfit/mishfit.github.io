That Which Is Caesar’s

This post could well have been titled “Don’t Let Socialist Atheists School You on Exegesis”, or “Occupy Democrats and the Lens Through Which They See Christians”, but since my premise largely hangs on Jesus’ political views, I figured I’d use his words. We don’t have to agree that Jesus, the man, was also God. Most people, however, at least agree that he was a man. I posit, that he was an apolitical man.


In times like these getting blocked on social media by an emotional user who lacks arguments is seen as a badge of honor. It appears I’m stacking up on badges. I often have all sorts of ad hominem thrown my way and I’m noticing it is mostly by what some colloquially call the “left”.

In this particular case I’d love to call my argumentative sparring partner all sorts of names. But his parents already gave him one. So I’ll use it here: *Richard Austrum III* (the 3rd, apparently).

An acquaintance on Facebook shared a meme which originated from __Occupy Democrats__. I assume that’s its origin as their watermark was proudly emblazoned in the lower left corner:

![Occupy Democrats Meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mishfit/mishfit.github.io/master/artifacts/14355080_1279780135386165_436891626060532352_n.jpg)

>“And then republican Jesus said: only feed the ones who pass the drug test”.

The image is of Jesus’ infamous multiplying of the loaves and fish. The text references "feed[ing]" what is presumed to be the poor.

This particular meme also contains a response from a well meaning apologist who falls into __Occupy Democrat's__ trap. He expands on what he thought Jesus meant, offering up scriptural references as backup, and also on what small government republicans, sometimes called conservatives, believe. Why is it a trap? Because the meme has several errors in logic that not only reveal biases, these errors allow a reasonable person to just throw up their hands and say, "I shouldn't bother arguing this, the premises are false". One doesn't have to be Christian to see the falsity, you just have to apply Christian theology appropriately, not what you think they believe...but what they claim to believe (no projecting!).

So *Richard* goes on to mock the apologist saying the apologist was probably serious when he wrote his response. I bet he was. He didn’t have to give his response though.

What __Occupy Democrats__ shows us in this meme is a their worldview (or the lens through which they view both republicans…and Christians…who aren’t synonymous by any means).

First, they presume to know how Christians view Jesus (as a republican or conservative). Interesting, so what about all the self-identified Democrats who also identify as Christian? Way to alienate your audience __Occupy Democrats__!

Secondly, they mix a political view into Christianity, and in particular, Jesus where no such relationship exists. And here’s why: when asked about taxes, probably as a curve ball question, Jesus replies, __*“give unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s”*__. There’s a lot of debate about this phrase and what it means. Some think Jesus is legitimizing the state and its claims against a Christian’s property. [However there is a large group of people who believe that Jesus is dismissing the question. Essentially he’s saying, “keep your politics out of my religion”](https://store.fee.org/products/rendering-unto-caesar-was-jesus-a-socialist). It’s interesting to note, Jesus doesn’t even expostulate on “what is Caesar’s” anyway. What does belong to the state? What is the proper role of "government"? It’s up to the individual to figure it out.

Thirdly, not only does __Occupy Democrats__ mix up politics and religion, they mix up religion and religion (okay, just two occurrences in the same religion...more on that later).

Back to Richard. I reply to his mocking comment:

>*"Voluntarily…not by force"*.

Richard’s initial response is:

![Richard Austrum's Comment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mishfit/mishfit.github.io/master/artifacts/richard-austrum-comment-1.png)

>??? Pretty sure Christ phrased it as a positive statement (i.e. You shall do this)…which is a pretty strong requirement. It has been a while since I went to Sunday School or cracked the New Testament, but pretty sure I am on the right track.

What he was missing here is that __Occupy Democrats__ is mixing a quip about the welfare state as it exists in the US *and* Christian theology. No where does Jesus tell us to setup a wealth redistribution mechanism. What’s worse, the meme is using the terms “feed” over an image of the multiplication of fish and bread. Jesus himself doesn’t use the word “feed” during this. That actually comes from his reinstatement of Peter after Peter’s denunciation of Jesus:


><p>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”</p>
><p>“Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.”</p>
><p>Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”</p>
><p>Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</p>
><p>He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”</p>
><p>Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”</p>
><p>The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</p>
><p>Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.”</p>
><p>Jesus said, “Feed my sheep.”</p>
`- John 21:15-17`

The term “feed” isn’t about physical food when addressed to Peter. It has nothing to do with feeding the poor. It is about proselytization.

__Occupy Democrats__ gets it all wrong here (the mixup to which I was referring earlier). Jesus doesn’t say you must feed anyone. Richard takes the fallacious argument and doubles down: saying that Jesus used the term “shall”.

I won’t go into too much about positive versus negative obligations. The interested can go search for that elsewhere. Suffice it to say there are things you should do, things you shall/must do (and their corollaries things you should not do and things you must no do).

Jesus never says you must do these things. Christianity is based on volition, free will….if you will. “Shall” comes up during the Ten Commandments but that isn’t limited to Christianity. More interestingly, “Shall” is accompanied by “not”…as in “You shall not murder” (or “thou shall not” for those old school among us). “Shall” is never used to refer to a positive obligation (you must do something). Christianity is also based on the premise that human nature is fallible. As humans Christians don’t always do what they should. While Christians should help the poor, the needy, they don't always. They don't always follow Jesus’ example. Whether a Christian does or not is the individual Christian’s choice and it doesn’t affect the Christian’s status as a Christian. It does let other people know whether that particular Christian’s convictions are held out in actions (does he walk the walk, or follow the path, etc.).

I remind Richard that Christianity is based on free will and choice. Here’s his response:

>So it is a choice to ignore strictures that are central and helps to create the foundation of Christianity? P.S. Even in the most voluntary (except for anarcho-capitalist BS) political theories you can be forced out of the society and shamed/ostracized for not doing your part for the public good. So the idea that being 'forced' to cover your part of public goods is somehow wrong is troubling. If you do not think the poor, disabled and unemployed are a 'Public Good' than I suggest you read about 'Structural Unemployment', 'Frictional Unemployment', and 'Hidden Unemployment'. To make it quick though, capitalism requires and necessitates a certain amount of unemployment and necessary short periods of unemployment. If there is very low to zero unemployment the system breaks. So, the system that gives us all these great things and a great quality of life requires people to be unemployed. The vast majority of Americans benefit from this situation, so it is our responsibility to take care of the unemployed as a 'Public Good’.

What can I say? Yes, it is a choice to ignore all or any part of the scripture. If it weren’t then there’d be no way to “choose Christ”. Let’s just say I’m not a determinist and that line of reasoning falls flat on its face (for me). He then goes on to suggest I read up about various forms of unemployment which most anarcho-capitalist (and I happen to consider myself and adherent, of sorts) do not believe exists. Why throw in unemployment anyway? We're not done discussing the demerits of the meme and he adds unemployment out of nowhere.

Whether or not there exists various forms of unemployment doesn’t matter, if one were to live in a truly free market. Richard then goes on to claim that capitalism requires a little unemployment otherwise the system breaks. Unemployment is not a requirement of capitalism. Think about it, why is it perfectly okay for little kids to sell lemonade by the side of the road but if an adult does it they require licensing from some government authority? That doesn’t sound like a free market to me. What if that adult was unemployed? The moment you start providing goods or services for another good, service, or medium of exchange (i.e. money/currency) in a voluntary mutually beneficial transaction you have de facto become a capitalist. It doesn’t matter if you have an employer or not. Unemployment only matters to the state. Richard's lens is exposed here: the poor could become self-employed capitalists but socialists never see them that way.

Richard then goes on to claim that the poor, disabled and unemployed are “Public Good[s]”. The poor disabled and unemployed are people, individuals. Oh sure, I’m just an ancap loon but I do believe in self-ownership. I cannot buy the poor, disabled, or unemployed. They cannot be shared in common with others. I cannot make ownership claims on their person. How are they “[public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good)”, again?

Anyway, Richard’s arguments start failing. He accuses me of not answering his questions. I tell him that his premises are faulty. He calls me a foolish childish person who should go STFU. I tell him *__“that’s not an argument”__*. He responds by blocking me. *Badge of honor unlocked*!

In summary, Jesus made it clear he was apolitical. He didn’t bow down to rulers. He is revered by Christian Republicans, Christian Democrats, and Christian centrists (or otherwise unaffiliated American Christians). Using him to further a political agenda is the first and most pertinent point where __Occupy Democrats__, and *Richard Austrum III*, fail miserably.
