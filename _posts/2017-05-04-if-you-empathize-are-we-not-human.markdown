If You Empathize (with us), Are We Not Human?

A while ago I completed the ["Empath-thon"](http://schoolsucksproject.com/podcast-466/) series on [the School Sucks Project](http://schoolsucksproject.com) podcast.

Forgive me for probably beating a dead horse. One thing bothered me during the series which I was having a hard time putting into words. I don't mean to criticize Stephanie Murphy or where she's coming from but when I hear someone say that in order to talk about a group (let's say, "Black Lives Matter", or black people) you must be a member of said group or have a member of that group present, I cringe.

I couldn't explain why, until now.

TL;DR

```
If you say you can't empathize with another group of human beings is that group of human beings really human to you?
```



Stealing heavily from Jordan Peterson quotes let's use the example of the three year old child.

Children at 3 years of age learn how to play games with other people. That means they learn how to organize their own internal motivational states into a hierarchy that includes the motivational states of other people and that is a necessary skill for play.

It's also necessary for abstract thought and empathy. It's something that we are good at doing and have been bred (for millennia) to be good at doing. Our bodies and brains can act as computational devices that run simulations of other consciousnesses and increase our understanding of abstract or foreign concepts/feelings/goals. We have empathy.

What's so interesting about this ability is that we can establish shared frames of reference and it organizes our emotions so they're predictable. I can watch you go through an experience and map parts of your goals onto my body and read off my emotional responses and understand an external consciousness.

I can do this because you and I are primates that resemble each other so closely that we are said to be of the same species, a particularly sentient one, but also, a particularly empathetic one.

If you can't empathize with my position, do you really consider me the same species as you? I think I can map your goals/frames of reference/emotions onto my consciousness and in so doing understand where you are coming from...can you do the same for me (regardless of my skin color which ultimately matters so little)?
