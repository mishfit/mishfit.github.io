## What? Where's the Privacy Policy?

This is my promise. I'm just a person not a conglomerate.
So while I'm not making guarantees, I can lay things out in plain english.

## Besides, What Do Policies Cover Anyway?

Am I right? There's usually a pretty long list of what data of yours ''may'' by used.
This blog is a static site hosted on Github Pages, there is no data.
Other than some really cool templates every thing you see is written by hand
(or copied and pasted from sites around the net much cooler than this one).

## Am I Tracking You?

In a manner of speaking, it depends. I do use Google Analytics so it's worth looking at [Google Analytic's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). 
I also use Disqus for comments, so take a look at the [Disqus's privacy policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).


## What About Cookies?

See the previous answer about Disqus and Google Analytics.

## So Who Do I Share This Information With?

You, if you want it. And then sometimes, you when you don't.
If there's something particularly interesting about the patterns of general usage
I see on this site, I might post aggregate stats about it here.

But seriously, in-depth statistics have failed to interest me too much since high school...
but I do love charts.
